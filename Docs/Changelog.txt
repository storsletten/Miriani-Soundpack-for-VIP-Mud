Version 5.13.29, released 2019-02-12:
* On a second thought, it is useful to know whether or not the vehicle is ascending or descending when it hits a pocket of fierce wind. So now the soundpack will indicate whether or not the vehicle is descending or ascending.

Version 5.13.28, released 2019-02-12:
* A few more atmo messages will now be gagged, such as the gust of fierce wind thing.

Version 5.13.27, released 2019-02-12:
* Added a bell sound for indicating Proxiani error. This works with Proxiani 1.0.20 and newer.

Version 5.13.26, released 2019-02-11:
* The soundpack will now send atsm to Proxiani if you're connected to Proxiani. This requires Proxiani version 1.0.17 or newer.

Version 5.13.25, released 2019-02-10:
* Fixed issues with default conf values not showing correctly.

Version 5.13.24, released 2019-02-04:
* Added more Proxiani OOB messages that the soundpack will understand, such as say, speech interrupt, and session info.

Version 5.13.23, released 2019-02-02:
* Added smf for smships full when connected to Proxiani.

Version 5.13.22, released 2019-02-02:
* Added a sound for Proxiani update notifications. You get update notifications for Proxiani if you run Proxiani from the Proxiani folder inside the shared soundpack folder in Dropbox, which is something I strongly recommend. If you don't have access to that shared folder in Dropbox, feel free to contact one of the Yobi's in Miriani for an invite.

Version 5.13.21, released 2019-01-31:
* Added a period at the end of item 12 in the main conf menu, since there was supposed to be a period there. Thank you Patric Avery for letting me know!

Version 5.13.20, released 2019-01-31:
* Fixed unclip sound playing unexpectedly in a Charming Existence (AIE Branch) at the Acrylon Spaceport. Thanks Anny Rain for reporting this!

Version 5.13.19, released 2019-01-31:
* Added options for private, chatter, and org channel sound volume offsets in conf com. Thanks to Ryan Salvatore for suggesting this!

Version 5.13.18, released 2019-01-31:
* Added a file called Proxiani.txt in the soundpack folder. It has information about Proxiani, including installation instructions.

Version 5.13.17, released 2019-01-28:
* Addressed an issue that caused camera feeds from droid remotes to be considered internal camera feeds if the droid was located inside a starship. Thanks to Moiraine for reporting this! And also, remember that comm-o 22 must be kept off if you want camera feeds from droids to be categorized as external camera feed by the vd command.

Version 5.13.16, released 2019-01-28:
* Added sensor interference to the list of things that the soundpack will read from Proxiani starmap OOB messages.

Version 5.13.15, released 2019-01-27:
* Fixed the scan all command doing weird things if used in simulators. Also added the tiny scan sound for it, plus some voice gagging for the title as well as speech interrupt.

Version 5.13.14, released 2019-01-26:
* SM filters are now disabled if Proxiani is enabled, since Proxiani now supports the entire suite of sm filters natively.

Version 5.13.13, released 2019-01-26:
* Added sma as an alias for smships assess, which is a brand new Proxiani feature that shows a rundown of how many of each type of praelor there are in the sector, sorted by tactical priority.

Version 5.13.12, released 2019-01-26:
* Fixed a bug with the way the soundpack interpreted certain smships output from Proxiani.

Version 5.13.11, released 2019-01-25:
* Changed the sms and smc commands to accommodate the new smships command in Proxiani. Also added smd for directions. And the smcount command has been changed to smt, for total, I guess.

Version 5.13.10, released 2019-01-24:
* Fixed error when a single period is received from Miriani.
* The sms and smc commands are now disabled if you're using Proxiani, since Proxiani has its own sms and smc commands that are a million times better.
* Added a framework for processing Proxiani OOB messages.
* Added speech interrupt and sound indicators for Proxiani sms and smc.

Version 5.13.9, released 2019-01-22:
* The proxiani command, or px for short, will now give you a slightly more useful response if you're not connected through Proxiani than just, I don't understand that.

Version 5.13.8, released 2019-01-22:
* Added support for incoming Proxiani command messages.
* Spreload will now preserve the Proxiani connection state. Also moved spreload into the main script file, which means you can spreload even if the soundpack failed to load the soundpack loader.
* Added px as an alias for the proxiani command.

Version 5.13.7, released 2019-01-20:
* The soundpack's keep alive feature will no longer alert you about broken connection if Proxiani has already notified you that auto reconnect is in progress.
* Fixed the archaeology thinggymabob saying feet instead of foot when it's exactly one foot.

Version 5.13.6, released 2019-01-20:
* Fixed issues that the soundpack had with the help file for getting started.
* The soundpack now knows that it should log you in and select your character automatically as soon as Proxiani has auto reconnected to Miriani after a connection failure.

Version 5.13.5, released 2019-01-20:
* Fixed conf room 10. Thanks to Jason Stone for reporting!

Version 5.13.4, released 2019-01-17:
* Fixed Shift F11 for toggling room sounds, which has been broken since version 5.13.1. Thanks to Kendle for reporting this!

Version 5.13.3, released 2019-01-16:
* Fixed message about shots seemingly having no effect not being properly gagged.

Version 5.13.2, released 2019-01-15:
* Removed support for interdiction field generators, since they don't exist in Miriani anymore.
* Fixed direction announcements and footstep sounds not working when following somebody into an airlock.
* Fixed sounds and stuffs for following or being dragged through a go exit.

Version 5.13.1, released 2019-01-13:
* Added options for direction announcements in conf room. I also changed conf room to be more than just room sound configuration, and moved room related options from certain other conf menus into conf room.
* Fixed direction announcements not working if you were stunned.

Version 5.13.0, released 2019-01-12:
* Added sounds for directions, which will be used when you follow somebody around. This requires sounds version 5.

Version 5.12.17, released 2019-01-07:
* The speech interrupt for insectoid creatures will no longer be used if the only insectoid creature in the room is the gargantuan Praelor mama from advanceds.

Version 5.12.16, released 2019-01-07:
* Slight performance improvement for the insectoid creature detector.

Version 5.12.15, released 2019-01-07:
* The insectoid creature detector will now properly count how many creatures are blocking the exits.

Version 5.12.14, released 2019-01-06:
* To help reduce ground combat spam, the lines of text about how streams of acid impact you and others will now be gagged if mission mode is enabled. Remember you can easily toggle mission mode by typing conf mission.

Version 5.12.13, released 2019-01-06:
* The insectoid creature detector will now also detect blocking creatures, and include the blocked directions in the status message.

Version 5.12.12, released 2019-01-06:
* Added an insectoid creature detector. It counts the number of insectoid creatures in the room. I also added a speech interrupt for this, which is enabled by default. You can disable it if you don't like it, in conf speech.

Version 5.12.11, released 2019-01-06:
* Added ping-pong sounds for the ping command. Sounds version 5 or greater is required for this to work.

Version 5.12.10, released 2019-01-06:
* Fixed issues with sounds when shooting the luminescent orifice.
* Added a sound to indicate when you get stunned, and also a sound for indicating that someone else gets stunned. This requires sounds version 5 or greater.
* The text indicating that you or someone else is out of ammo will no longer be voice gagged if the mission mode conditions are true.
* Mission mode will no longer voice gag the output if somebody shoots to kill the gargantuan multi colored ... you know, from advanced missions.

Version 5.12.9, released 2019-01-06:
* Fixed incorrect sound being played when you get shot. Now there's a slight difference in sound between you getting shot versus someone else getting shot.

Version 5.12.8, released 2019-01-06:
* Fixed more issues related to the way the ground combat framework handles stun armor.

Version 5.12.7, released 2019-01-06:
* The ground combat framework will now also recognize stun armor, and properly compact that output into just one single word.

Version 5.12.6, released 2019-01-05:
* The ground combat framework will now voice gag the output if you fire at the same target with the same weapon, or if the same third person shooter fires at the same target with the same weapon. This helps reducing spam even further.

Version 5.12.5, released 2019-01-05:
* Fixed an obscure issue where the ground combat framework wouldn't fully detect all events if someone fires at someone else who is taking cover behind yet another somebody who partially absorbs the hit and gets stunned in the process.

Version 5.12.4, released 2019-01-05:
* Fixed shooting sounds for droids not working.

Version 5.12.3, released 2019-01-05:
* Fixed a few more minor issues with the new ground combat framework. It will now also tell you that person shoots to kill if they fire at a insectoid creature using praelor mags. Remember that mission mode will mute speech for those messages, but you can still see it in the output window.

Version 5.12.2, released 2019-01-05:
* Fixed incorrect gunshot sound being played when the shot misses or the target dodges the shot.

Version 5.12.1, released 2019-01-05:
* Fixed an issue where one of the messages from the luminescent orifice were processed incorrectly.

Version 5.12.0, released 2019-01-05:
* Rewrote the ground combat framework. One awesome benefit is that most shooting is now compacted to just one line, so ground combat should be less spammy. The soundpack is now also much better at telling you who's gun is out of ammo. And when your gun runs out of ammo, it will even play a little beep to let you know that you need to reload. If something is broken as a result of these changes, please do let me know!

Version 5.11.16, released 2019-01-04:
* Minor fixes and adjustments for the ground praelor stuff. Now it won't claim that a praelor is dead when it's in fact just dying. Also the sound when your character is being attacked should be slightly more distinct now.

Version 5.11.15, released 2019-01-04:
* Fixed attacks by insectoid creatures on yourself not being recognized by the soundpack.

Version 5.11.14, released 2019-01-01:
* Added a sound alert for when that gargantuan ... insectoid creature in advanced missions wiggles out of your grip.

Version 5.11.13, released 2019-01-01:
* Added sounds for the headdesk social.
* Fixed lockbox closing sound not working. Thanks to Jason Stone for bringing this to my attention!

Version 5.11.12, released 2018-12-16:
* Fixed sound thinggymabob for the starships and the vehicles commands.

Version 5.11.11, released 2018-12-16:
* Added a low rumbling sound for docking into another ship. This requires sounds version 4 or later. Also fixed the docking complete sound so that it works throughout the entire ship, not just in the control room.

Version 5.11.10, released 2018-12-15:
* Added a sound for indicating that a tactically dangerous praelor ship has entered the sector. A few examples of ships that are classified as dangerous are muzano, potate, and ohaxx. This might be useful when flying random diffs or invasions.

Version 5.11.9, released 2018-12-05:
* The rendition of Jingle Bells being played by green Santa boxes will now be muted if conf ship 14 is enabled.

Version 5.11.8, released 2018-12-05:
* For those of you who use the shared Dropbox folder for sounds, there's now a sound for the green Santa boxes. You can type spinfo to see which version of the sounds you're using. It needs to be version 4 for this to work. There will be no difference for those who have an older version of the sounds folder.

Version 5.11.7, released 2018-12-05:
* From now on, the soundpack will unregister and re-register when you type spreload, ensuring that Miriani knows which version you're using at all times. This is useful in case of version specific restrictions or accommodations on the server side.
* The babies extra will now play the toddle sound when a baby toddles from one room to another.

Version 5.11.6, released 2018-12-05:
* After a little more testing, it turned out that 37.5 percent panning is enough for the random panning routines, and now it should definitely be possible to pick up all sounds even with only one ear.

Version 5.11.5, released 2018-12-05:
* Removed the pitch adjustment of room sounds when the starship crashes into solar debris, and also changed the random panning of weapon sounds and more so that it never exceeds 62.5 percent panning in either direction.

Version 5.11.4, released 2018-12-04:
* Fixed an issue with SP repair notifications showing up even if you're standing in the engineering room. Thanks to Tristina Cantrell for reporting!

Version 5.11.3, released 2018-12-03:
* Removed some of the room sounds for engineering that didn't contain any soft beeps, since the room description refers to occasional soft beeps emanating from consoles. Also fixed storage crawlspaces so they no longer sound like control rooms.

Version 5.11.2, released 2018-12-03:
* Addressed issues with point unit output. Now it should work with org points as well. Also removed the conf option for showing last known points out of comms range, since this is now a game feature.

Version 5.11.1, released 2018-12-02:
* The soundpack will no longer spend resources trying to figure out what room sound to use if the WALK command takes you to a room with the exact same name as the room you just left.
* Applied voice gagging for repetition of room titles in certain situations, such as when you use the walk command and several rooms have the same name, or if you spacewalk and the room title obviously remains unchanged.

Version 5.11.0, released 2018-12-01:
* Implemented a much better way of dealing with room sounds. As a result, partial room sound mode is no longer necessary, and has been removed from conf.
* Added full support for the WALK command. Now room sounds will update as you walk, and output text should be less verbose.
* Fixed an issue with repair notifications not working if you used the WALK command to leave the engineering room.

Version 5.10.1, released 2018-12-01:
* The repair notification thinggy will now wait for 60 seconds before it considers the repairs to have stopped, since 45 seconds weren't enough apparently.

Version 5.10.0, released 2018-11-30:
* Changed the random pan routine of the sound engine so that it never pans a sound more than 62.5 percent in either direction. This will help for those moments when you have only one functional speaker or earbud in a stereo pair.
* Added an option in conf ship that lets you enable repair notifications outside the engineering room. These notifications are based on approximations provided by the game and so you shouldn't expect complete accuracy, but nevertheless this feature could be useful.

Version 5.9.56, released 2018-11-29:
* Changed the wording of a certain repair message, thanks to Patric Avery.

Version 5.9.55, released 2018-11-24:
* Added support for sooc. Version 4 of the sounds folder has a slightly modified rooc sound for sooc, which is currently only available for those who have access to the shared Dropbox folder for sounds.

Version 5.9.54, released 2018-11-15:
* Added more ship rooms that the soundpack now will recognize, including Control Center, Bedrooms of all kinds, Cargo Bay, and Combat Stations.

Version 5.9.53, released 2018-11-14:
* Added a workaround for the bugs that arise as a result of VIP Mud breaking up the lines of text for room exits.

Version 5.9.52, released 2018-10-25:
* Added sound for when someone else digs up an archaeological artifact. Also added sound when you have no free hands at the time of digging up an artifact.

Version 5.9.51, released 2018-10-05:
* Hist (and history) have now been changed to SPHB. And to make it more convenient, you can now use spr for SPHB read, spc for SPHB copy, and sps for SPHB switch. Sounds confusing to you? Just type sph to see a quick and dirty command reference for the history buffers.

Version 5.9.50, released 2018-09-25:
* Added a new beep mode for rel drive in conf ship.

Version 5.9.49, released 2018-09-12:
* Fixed an issue with SM filters not gagging certain starmap titles.

Version 5.9.48, released 2018-08-18:
* Fixed duplicate knocking sound when somebody knocks on the hull of the starship you're in.

Version 5.9.47, released 2018-08-13:
* The soundpack will now say the word locked after starship weapons are locked onto a set of coordinates. Hopefully no more wondering if you're lagging just because you aimed at empty space.

Version 5.9.46, released 2018-08-12:
* SM filters (like sms and smc) might now be a little more resilient when processing a huge number of ships. A consequence is that the output of these commands won't be added to the output history buffer, because VIP Mud just doesn't want to let me do that when using this workaround. Basically there are at least three serious bugs in VIP Mud that I'm trying to juggle workarounds for here, and it's just not possible to make it perfect. Also, SM filters will no longer show starships that occupy the same coordinates. If you don't like this, then let me know and maybe I can make a conf option for it. I might even be able to make a conf option for the workaround that inadvertently prevents the SM filter output from being reviewed by the history buffer for general output. Oh and lastly, thanks to Cria for making me change this.

Version 5.9.45, released 2018-07-15:
* Added an option in conf speech to set default speech type for the user specifyable voice in VIP Mud.
* Fixed a bug that meant speech settings in VIP Mud did not update when you changed them in conf speech.
* Added acceleration for the Spacepace game. It will now accelerate for every 50th level until you're at level 200, at which point each object exists for only 2 seconds from start to end.
* Numerous bug fixes for Spacepace.

Version 5.9.44, released 2018-07-13:
* Added an audio game to the soundpack. It's called Spacepace, and before you can play it you need to enable it through conf x. Just type conf x spacepace, and then type spacepace help to see instructions on how to play. It's a silly little game for those moments when you don't have anything better to do. It uses sounds from the soundpack. I wrote it as a little exercise for myself, but if anyone likes it then feel free to give me feedback. I might even be persuaded to add more features to it if somebody has any suggestions.

Version 5.9.43, released 2018-07-06:
* Fixed an issue with the NIRP extra where the workaround for one of VIP Mud's annoying division bugs did not kick in under certain conditions, causing VIP Mud's division bug to kick your butt instead.

Version 5.9.42, released 2018-07-04:
* Changed the trigger for the COURSE command so that it recognizes the new output text.

Version 5.9.41, released 2018-07-01:
* Added more things to the RP history buffer. Sitting, standing, buckling, unbuckling, and pulling people to their feet.

Version 5.9.40, released 2018-07-01:
* Added a history buffer for RP stuff. It will include emotes, socials, and other things people say in the room. Remember that you can use Control E for switching between history buffers, and Control W and Control Q for reviewing them. You can also type HIST S RP for printing out the entire RP history buffer.

Version 5.9.39, released 2018-06-01:
* Added an option for displaying a message when roundtime is over. Thanks Ryan Salvatore for expressing a dire need for this feature.

Version 5.9.38, released 2018-05-21:
* Added more ship classes to the NIRP extra. It should be able to recognize most ship classes now, although I'm not sure if the speed values are very accurate. Feel free to report if something seems a little bit off. The soundpack will now also remember the speed value across sessions. Thanks to Kendle for being an eager helper. It was the motivation I needed to make this change!

Version 5.9.37, released 2018-05-20:
* Added a NIRP extra that calculates ETA for your destinations. After enabling this extra by typing conf x nirp, you can set the average travel speed using the SetSpeed command. Alternatively you can use the ABOUT command, and the soundpack will attempt to guess the speed for you based on the ship class. Only transversers are recognized at this point, and it assumes that transversers can make 80 sectors per hour. P.S. VIP Mud whines about bad expression if the result of a division operation is greater than 32767. Therefore it might break if the ratio between distance and speed is too large. I added a few conditions to help prevent some of these cases, but it's still possible to cause errors if you play with great distances and/or low speed values. P.P.S. Because VIP Mud doesn't even support numbers with fractions, I had to invent some more bullshit routines to make this work. It may or may not cause weird bugs. Let's hope GMA Games will one day release a version of VIP Mud that is capable of reliably performing basic arithmetic operations.

Version 5.9.36, released 2018-03-15:
* Addressed an error that could pop up in some instances when aiming at starships. Thanks Anara Webster for reporting this!

Version 5.9.35, released 2018-02-11:
* Changed the post extra so that it won't overwrite the current message unless you type post new.
* Fixed the letter y weirdly appearing in external PA messages sometimes.

Version 5.9.34, released 2017-12-28:
* Improved the way the archaeology framework handles output from directional scanners when conf gadget 8 is off.
* Changed the room title formatter so that coordinates are displayed first in dynamic rooms (like dig sites and asteroids). Thanks Beatrice for bringing this to my attention. I'm sorry it took so long to get this done.

Version 5.9.33, released 2017-12-28:
* Fixed a bug with default and current values in choice based conf options.
* Changing binary conf options without going through the menus will now indicate the title of the option you're adjusting.

Version 5.9.32, released 2017-12-28:
* Added an option for showing digging depth in archaeology. It can be found in conf gadgets.

Version 5.9.31, released 2017-12-21:
* Added a post extra that makes it easier to post messages from a text editor like Notepad. It can be enabled using conf x post, and the command to use it is just POST.

Version 5.9.30, released 2017-12-18:
* Fixed an issue that caused a lot of errors if the script path or the sounds path contained any at symbols. You might need to reinstall the soundpack for this fix to take effect (if this was an issue for you in the first place). The linking scripts have been updated, although the most recent linking script for sounds have not been uploaded to the zip file for sounds yet. I included them in the zip file for the soundpack itself for now, so just copy them from there into your Miriani Sounds folder for now.

Version 5.9.29, released 2017-12-06:
* The soundpack will now respect room-o 22, but it will only say if a room is outdoors. Indoors is implied by the lack of outdoors.

Version 5.9.28, released 2017-12-05:
* Fixed a bug that preventedd the soundpack from differentiating between indoor and outdoor rooms.

Version 5.9.27, released 2017-12-04:
* Starmap filters should now work in observation centers too. Hopefully.

Version 5.9.26, released 2017-12-03:
* Fixed issues with asteroid rovers. Now it should display the coordinates you move to, as well as processing the possible exits properly.

Version 5.9.25, released 2017-12-03:
* Added support for the jet black Santa boxes. Super squeezy hugs to Tom Tucker for contributing fully functional code for this. Thaaanks!

Version 5.9.24, released 2017-12-03:
* Possibly fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in the starship detected sound being played when looking at the starmap.

Version 5.9.23, released 2017-11-19:
* The scan filter for starships now includes org tags. Unfortunately I had to reset all scan filter formatters to their default values, so you may need to reconfigure your scan filters if you don't like those default settings.

Version 5.9.22, released 2017-11-12:
* Fixed ammo unload sound being triggered by the room description at Outreach Mineral Processor Docking Bay. Thank you Anny Rain for reporting this.

Version 5.9.21, released 2017-11-10:
* Fixed virtual display configurations not migrating correctly from 1.1 to 2.0.

Version 5.9.20, released 2017-10-29:
* Shortened the message you see when you start walking using the WALK command.

Version 5.9.19, released 2017-10-29:
* Fixed an error when using medical bays. Thanks to Moiraine Soto for reporting this.

Version 5.9.18, released 2017-10-29:
* Made the start and end of streamed board posts less verbose.

Version 5.9.17, released 2017-10-29:
* Added the starship detected sound for when you scan an asteroid that has one or more starships on it. Thanks to Amy Draksen for suggesting this.

Version 5.9.16, released 2017-10-22:
* Changed repair messages. The ETA command will now show the time first, and the CHECK command will show the amount of damage first.

Version 5.9.15, released 2017-10-21:
* Improved the focus output formatter string. Now it supports X, Y, and Z. It has also been moved from conf scan to conf ship. Furthermore, instead of showing the word unchanged, it will now beep when the coordinates change.

Version 5.9.14, released 2017-10-21:
* Fixed an oversight in the ship computer framework that prevented it from playing the control room report sound sometimes.

Version 5.9.13, released 2017-10-19:
* Merged the list of actions into the list of socials, since it's all just socials anyway. This also gives a little performance boost, since I could remove alot of duplicated code.

Version 5.9.12, released 2017-10-19:
* Added sound support for emotes. Remember to enable emotes in conf socials if you turned it off in a previous life.

Version 5.9.11, released 2017-10-19:
* Fixed certain starmap titles not being gagged when using starmap filters. Thanks Michael Calaway for reporting this!

Version 5.9.10, released 2017-10-18:
* Now it will also recognize vacuum-sealed packets of frozen food resembling star-shaped cookies. Hurray!

Version 5.9.9, released 2017-10-18:
* The soundpack will now attempt to be extra informational when you snatch artifacts from space. Maybe this will work when you look at artifacts too. Who knows.

Version 5.9.8, released 2017-10-18:
* SmFilters will try harder to avoid gagging things they shouldn't gag.

Version 5.9.7, released 2017-10-16:
* Cleaned up some legacy code related to speech types that was only relevant in VIP Mud 1.1. Speech types in VIP Mud 2.0 can be either None, Sapi, or Screen reader.

Version 5.9.6, released 2017-10-15:
* Removed the entire experience level framework. It might make the soundpack slightly faster, and maybe it will also help bypassing the bug in VIP Mud that prevents aliases and keystrokes from being loaded properly.

Version 5.9.5, released 2017-10-14:
* Fixed a small bug with how conf exp 2 treated messages about lights flashing overhead.

Version 5.9.4, released 2017-10-08:
* Removed the conf option to have variables expanded in the entry window, since it served no purpose other than to fuck up things for people. As a consequence, I also removed conf vip, since there was only one option left in there and I thought it would be better to just move it to conf gen.

Version 5.9.3, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed SPTest not working. Thanks Cria for reporting this.

Version 5.9.2, released 2017-10-08:
* The prod social will now produce the same sound as the poke social.

Version 5.9.1, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed a bug in the conf loader that meant class states for socials, actions, and emotes weren't updated when using conf load.

Version 5.9.0, released 2017-10-08:
* For 2.0: Redesigned the soundpack loading framework. Hopefully the new one is a little bit faster and more stable. There might be a few new bugs though as a result of this change, but feel free to report them through appropriate channels, such as the soundpack metaf, or the soundpack board.
* For 2.0: Removed the option to save configuration when idle, since it's just unnecessary. The option to auto save on exit is much better.
* For 1.1: Officially discontinuing to maintain the soundpack for 1.1. Future updates will apply for 2.0 only, unless changelog entries indicate otherwise. The SP for 1.1 will no longer notify you of soundpack updates.
